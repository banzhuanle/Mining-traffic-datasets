# Mining traffic datasets
This project is about mining traffic data in paperï¼ˆanonymous).
Various types of mining traffic data we have collected in recent months are open source for follow-up researchers to use.
The dataset covers encrypted and unencrypted mining traffic, as well as mining traffic based on IPv4 / IPv6 transmission.
The main currency types include Ethereum and Monroe.And some other types of digital currencies.
At present, we only upload the traffic data generated by encrypted mining for about 24 hours. The remaining data needs to wait for the relevant papers to be retrieved before uploading
The type of data is indicated in the download file. Due to the size limit of uploaded content on the website, more data will be obtained from download links.We put the download links in "Get download address" file.
